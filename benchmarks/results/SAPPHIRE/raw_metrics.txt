    CPU Time: 0.105s
    Memory Bound: 20.7% of Pipeline Slots
     | The metric value is high. This may indicate that a significant fraction

     | bandwidth information, and correlation by memory objects.

        L1 Bound: 25.0% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing the
         | L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest latency.
         | However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older stores, a load
         | might suffer a high latency even though it is being satisfied by the
         | L1.
         |
        L2 Bound: 25.0% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled on L2 cache. Avoiding

    Memory Bound: 20.5% of Pipeline Slots
     | The metric value is high. This may indicate that a significant fraction

        L1 Bound: 12.5% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing the

         | However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older stores, a load

    Memory Bound: 33.4% of Pipeline Slots
     | The metric value is high. This may indicate that a significant fraction
     | of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load
     | and stores. Explore the metric breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory
     | bandwidth information, and correlation by memory objects.
     |
        L1 Bound: 16.9% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing the
         | L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest latency.
         | However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older stores, a load
         | might suffer a high latency even though it is being satisfied by the
         | L1.
         |
        L2 Bound: 23.8% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled on L2 cache. Avoiding
         | cache misses (L1 misses/L2 hits) will improve the latency and

    Memory Bound: 20.8% of Pipeline Slots
     | The metric value is high. This may indicate that a significant fraction
     | of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load
     | and stores. Explore the metric breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory
     | bandwidth information, and correlation by memory objects.

        L1 Bound: 12.5% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing the
         | L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest latency.
         | However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older stores, a load
         | might suffer a high latency even though it is being satisfied by the
         | L1.

         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled on L2 cache. Avoiding

    Memory Bound: 26.7% of Pipeline Slots
     | The metric value is high. This may indicate that a significant fraction
     | of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load
     | and stores. Explore the metric breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory
     | bandwidth information, and correlation by memory objects.
     |
        L1 Bound: 23.4% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing the
         | L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest latency.
         | However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older stores, a load
         | might suffer a high latency even though it is being satisfied by the
         | L1.
         |
        L2 Bound: 10.6% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled on L2 cache. Avoiding
         | cache misses (L1 misses/L2 hits) will improve the latency and

    Increase execution time:
     | Application execution time is too short. Metrics data may be unreliable.
     | Consider reducing the sampling interval or increasing your application

    Memory Bound: 54.4% of Pipeline Slots
     | The metric value is high. This may indicate that a significant fraction
     | of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load
     | and stores. Explore the metric breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory
     | bandwidth information, and correlation by memory objects.

        L1 Bound: 11.5% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing the
         | L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest latency.
         | However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older stores, a load
         | might suffer a high latency even though it is being satisfied by the
         | L1.
         |
        L2 Bound: 11.8% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled on L2 cache. Avoiding
         | cache misses (L1 misses/L2 hits) will improve the latency and
         | increase performance.
         |
        L3 Bound: 34.3% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often CPU was stalled on L3 cache, or contended

         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing the

         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing the
